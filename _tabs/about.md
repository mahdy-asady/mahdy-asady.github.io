Welcome to **Bytes and Breakpoints**! This is where I share my journey as an embedded software developer, diving into coding, electronics, and the occasional debugging nightmare. With experience in embedded Linux, microcontrollers, and system management, I'll be posting tutorials, tips, and insights as I explore the world of embedded systems.   Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, hopefully thereâ€™s something here for you. It's great to have you here!
